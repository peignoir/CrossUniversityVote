# CrossUniversityVote
## Open Source Decentralized Cross Voting platform for universities 

The purpose of the project is to organize a cross-university vote in 2020 using a common voting application. Each university will use the voting application for its own internal governance (election of studentsâ€™ delegates) but votes will synchronized to ensure maximum visibility. 

As a placeholder the current project is a fork of https://github.com/vinhyenvodoi98/voting-with-blockchain-tezos
